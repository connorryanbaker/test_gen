a/A random test generator for week 1



shout out mallory bulkley who actually came up with this idea !!!

https://github.com/mallorybulkley/aa-practice-test-generator

how to use

1. run git clone https://github.com/connorryanbaker/aA-test-gen
2. cd test-gen
3. run the command ruby generator.rb
4. cd practice\_test (if you have multiple practice\_test directories they will be incremented, practice\_test-2, practice\_test-3 etc)
3. bundle install
4. run bundle exec rspec and you should be good to go!


this problem set does include some of the more difficult problems that will not be on the assessment.
you can rerun the command ruby generator.rb and a new directory will be created for you with a new random assessment.
each assessment has 5 random questions; they could be about different topics, they could all be about arrays ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
